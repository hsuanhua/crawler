      "0   Oct 5, 2021   [The movie] is phenomenal. ... This is brilliant casting ... It's Gleeson's performance as the institutional representative that sells the film's recklessly excessive 80s vibe.\n",
      "1   Mar 1, 2021   There's more character work in any episode of Breaking Bad or Narcos than American Made's entire 115 minute running time but Cruise's movie does have a sense of humour about itself that makes for an amiable, if not memorable, watch.\n",
      "2   Nov 5, 2020   Despite a strong Tom Cruise performance, the movie is as generic as its title.\n",
      "3   Sep 2, 2020   There was a time when I looked forward to a Tom Cruise motion picture.\n",
      "4   Jul 23, 2020   It just sort of putts along, rough around the edges and unjustifiably confident in itself, like a rich guy wasted on cocaine.\n",
      "5   Jul 1, 2020   Worth watching to see Tom Cruise as good as he's been in years.\n",
      "6   Jun 29, 2020   American Made is one of the best kinds of biopics: A tale that makes me want to explore the story further and find out more about its subject. Even if only half of this film is true to life, it's still 100% crazy.\n",
      "7   Jun 27, 2020   Tom Cruise's charisma makes Barry Seal a captivating character, presenting in his story the most brazen side of the American dream. [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "8   May 14, 2020   American Made is riddled with flaws in both its storytelling and some of the performances, but that doesn't stop Cruise from smoothing over a lot of the rougher edges and bringing it together with a rip-roaring performance.\n",
      "9   Jan 16, 2020   Cruise turns up the douche flow to maximum and it works like a charm.\n",
      "10   Jan 10, 2020   A classic 90s style Tom Cruise movie of fun adventures in the drug smuggling world.\n",
      "11   Oct 10, 2019   A great summer film that deserves to be the 2017 effort from Tom Cruise that everyone remembers, for all the right reasons.\n",
      "12   Sep 27, 2019   American Made occasionally amuses and provokes a hearty guffaw or two by its end. As a biopic it's insubstantial, but as a Tom Cruise vehicle it's alright..\n",
      "13   Sep 20, 2019   Both [Doug] Liman and [Tom] Cruise saw that humor in [Barry] Seal's operations and project it well. His squirming out of life threatening situations is hilarious.\n",
      "14   Aug 13, 2019   The interesting thing about its volatile proposal is this impassable commitment to humor. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "15   Jul 21, 2019   Just when it seemed as if we had lost Tom Cruise to the ranks of paycheck-cashing automatons no longer interested in applying themselves on screen, along comes American Made to show there's still some life left in the maverick actor.\n",
      "16   Jul 17, 2019   Cruise has always been a monolith of quintessential Americana, but with the aging cracks in his well-worn facade, he's been doing even more fascinating work.\n",
      "17   Jun 4, 2019   It's the inherent ridiculousness of it all that makes the film so compelling, and Liman uses Cruise's smarmy sense of charm to maximum effect.\n",
      "18   May 17, 2019   American Made might be telling an interesting true story but a dragging pace and the juxtaposition between tone and content hurt the production overall.\n",
      "19   Feb 28, 2019   American Made frustratingly never digs quite as deep as one might hope, but while the high is a fleeting one it's certainly exhilarating while it lasts.\n",
      "0   Feb 18, 2019   Curiously effective and engaging when portraying the realistic side of this fantastic true story. [Full review in Spanish].\n",
      "1   Feb 11, 2019   American Made isn't a great movie, but it is an entertaining one. And much of the credit for that can be laid at the feet of Cruise; this film reaffirms the fact that he remains one of the last few true movie stars.\n",
      "2   Jan 30, 2019   A fun film filled with performances that are perfect for the story that it's trying to tell. [Full Review in Spanish]\n",
      "3   Dec 21, 2018   There's an intoxicating energy to this unbelievable story, as director Doug Liman plays fast and loose with the actual facts and events.\n",
      "4   Dec 11, 2018   The use of Tommy C's winning smile, reminiscent from his Risky Business days, is about the only thing this movie got right for me.\n",
      "5   Nov 11, 2018   Tom Cruise and director Doug Liman tell an interesting true story that plays like Goodfellas mixed with Top Gun ...\n",
      "6   Nov 2, 2018   American Made. What a suiting title for a Tom Cruise vehicle.\n",
      "7   Oct 31, 2018   [Tom] Cruise is able to make us like an irredeemable character without ever putting us on his side or making us complicit in his wrongdoing. That's a tough trick to pull off, and I doubt it would be as effective for anyone other than Cruise.\n",
      "8   Oct 31, 2018   It doesn't really feel interested in Seal as a character - we don't find out much about him other than the things that supposedly happened to him without any real insight into his decisions or why he made them.\n",
      "9   Oct 31, 2018   Cruise, sporting a Southern accent, is magnetic, a presence with gravity, one that drives the energy of each scene.\n",
      "10   Oct 20, 2018   With a thundering pace and fun energy, American Made is a winner and highlights Tom Cruise at his energetically charming best.\n",
      "11   Oct 5, 2018   The film wholeheartedly embraces its trashiness and spins a mightily entertaining yarn in the process.\n",
      "12   Aug 30, 2018   American Made's creative style of storytelling along with the bond between Cruise and director Liman makes this biopic one of the best movies of Cruise's career\n",
      "13   Aug 28, 2018   American Made doesn't want to do breast-beating. In the end, it feels like a dramatized story from John Oliver or Jimmy Kimmel, jocular as we're watching, horrifying as we let the full impact sink in.\n",
      "14   Aug 27, 2018   American Made may not be first-tier action, but it more than makes up for The Mummy.\n",
      "15   Aug 20, 2018   I spent a lot of the film just feeling like it's ridiculous that these awful men just keep living on in our memories as we glorify their lives of crime.\n",
      "16   Jun 11, 2018   Rather than serving as another vehicle for Cruise's charisma, American Made acts as a showcase for supporting player Domhnall Gleeson, who nearly walks away with the movie despite his limited screen time.\n",
      "17   May 23, 2018   Barry Seal isn't even really a hero, but he's not that great of a criminal either. He just seems to be a string of one liners and even when he's knees deep in coke, he's still just that little bit lame.\n",
      "18   Feb 1, 2018   You have to wonder if the real Barry Seal was as likable as the new true-crime thriller, American Made, makes him out to be, or if it's simply Tom Cruise's toothy charisma that makes him seem so.\n",
      "19   Jan 24, 2018   American made is worth watching...it's a fascinating look at the \"War on Drugs.\"\n",
      "0   Jan 23, 2018   Charismatic as ever, Tom Cruise keeps American Made flying high.\n",
      "1   Jan 12, 2018   American Made is as middle-of-the-road as they come; if the weather is particular depressing and you genuinely have nothing better to do - we've all been there - think about giving American Made a go.\n",
      "2   Jan 4, 2018   The Barry Seal you see onscreen is the man Cruise wants you to see: a guy with limited skills and a lot of dumb luck. It's an energetic and convincing performance.\n",
      "3   Dec 28, 2017   \"Made\" is a hugely entertaining and unpredictable blend of a less offensive Wolf of Wall Street and a Southern-fried Goodfellas.\n",
      "4   Dec 28, 2017   ... it's fun, bold, smart and a return to form for Cruise... [Full review in Spanish]\n",
      "5   Dec 27, 2017   American Made is ultimately an anodyne cautionary tale, even if it has a swell time hanging out with psychopaths and is almost light-hearted in the portrayal of drug trafficking and murder.\n",
      "6   Dec 22, 2017   American Made is a great laugh if like me you're happy enough watching rise-and-fall tales of American hubris you've seen a few times before\n",
      "7   Dec 18, 2017   It's easy to root for Seal, because it seems like he's just along for the ride because it's more fun than flying short hops for TWA. And we're along for the ride, because this is a way better Tom Cruise movie than The Mummy.\n",
      "8   Dec 6, 2017   Antiheroes require an actor that radiates charisma, so it's no shock that Tom Cruise (reunited with Edge of Tomorrow director Doug Liman) makes for a likable drug runner, gun smuggler, and greedy scumbag whose financial thirst cannot be quenched\n",
      "9   Nov 11, 2017   ...a sporadically intriguing yet hopelessly slapdash endeavor that could (and should) have been so much better...\n"

      "5   Oct 18, 2017   Cruise gets to toy with his trademark cockiness in ways that are consistently amusing, and we're quickly reminded of why his star persona has proved so indelible for so long.\n",
      "6   Oct 17, 2017   The joy in watching \"American Made\" is considerably driven by Cruise's wide-eyed astonishment with every twist and turn happening to Seal. This is a role that was tailor-made for the 55-year-old-actor.\n",
      "7   Oct 13, 2017   But by the time the movie roared to its shockingly grim, remarkably embittered ending, American Made had won me over.\n",

      "14   Oct 10, 2017   Writing that this is \"historically inaccurate\" doesn't do it justice...Regardless of the silly political stuff Liman tries to foist on the audience, the movie is very well done and is highly entertaining.\n",
      "15   Oct 9, 2017   Its colorful style recalls the flamboyant amorality of GoodFellas and Blow, and it's often funnier and more succinct than either.\n",

      "3   Oct 5, 2017   American Made is the kind of movie that insists reality is much more implausible - and entertaining - than fiction.\n",
      "4   Oct 5, 2017   Cruise is locked in, with a slight Southern drawl painted over his usual onscreen persona, but it's a good fit for his movie star charms. He's having fun, so the audience follows.\n",
      "5   Oct 5, 2017   One assumes that Cruise got this film made, yet he's a terrible fit for the role: he's always done his best work portraying smart, insightful characters in dramatic stories, but Seal was a yahoo whose sorry escapades are played here for cynical laughs.\n",
      "6   Oct 4, 2017   Edgy, engaging and adrenaline-charged, proving once again that America is the land of opportunity....\n",
      "7   Oct 4, 2017   The result is an easy old watch that doesn't stretch Cruise one jot and gives him plenty of opportunity to combine floppy fringe and flashes of pearly whites to familiar effect.\n",
      "8   Oct 3, 2017   American Made is first and foremost Cruise's chance to show who's still top gun, down to the aviator trade and sunglasses.\n",
      "9   Oct 3, 2017   American Made is a conventional true story crime caper that stays afloat thanks to Liman's solid direction and Cruise's committed turn as an antihero.\n",
      "10   Oct 3, 2017   I'm sure in 20 years' time we will be watching another hot actor (or maybe actress) show us a story of the nutty crap that is probably going on as we speak in the current administration.\n",
      "11   Oct 2, 2017   The tragedy is all there: the coke-fuelled Icarus, the shadow side of the Reagan era, and our perpetual need to make heroes. American Made knows what it is, yet, by for the very same reason, it can't explore the tragic side. It wouldn't be American.\n",
      "12   Oct 2, 2017   Tom Cruise's latest is almost subversive in its breezy, anti-US attitude.\n",
      "13   Oct 2, 2017   Without realizing it, American Made is a wincing metaphor for Tom Cruise's movie career-which, come to think of it, is exclusively and embarrassingly American made, too.\n",
      "14   Oct 2, 2017   Well-crafted, if woefully familiar.\n",
      "15   Oct 2, 2017   American Made gives director Doug Liman and charismatic star Tom Cruise a superior vehicle and plays to their strengths. It's a solid piece of entertainment that takes a stranger-than-fiction story and brings it to life in convincing fashion.\n",
      "16   Oct 1, 2017   This is Cruise's show all the way, and he delivers with a performance that will take you higher than any drug or airplane ever could.\n",

      "19   Sep 29, 2017   Liman appears to be the only director working these days that can pull old Tom Cruise out of his malaise and make him deliver the performances we know Tom Cruise can deliver.\n",
      "0   Sep 29, 2017   Following The Mummy, American Made is easily the best Tom Cruise film of 2017, though it never strikes quite the right tone for the story it's trying to tell.\n",
      "1   Sep 29, 2017   This is a black comedy, and irony isn't Cruise's most natural mode, yet by playing Seal as a slightly dimwitted cheeseball on the make, he gets into the movie's you-can't-make-up-this-stuff spirit.\n",

      "6   Sep 29, 2017   It's nobody's idea of an action masterpiece. But American Made is a blast, leveraging star Tom Cruise's on-screen wattage and comedic sense while telling a heck of a story that again confirms truth is stranger than fiction.\n",
      "7   Sep 29, 2017   The quick smile and familiar Cruise charm is obviously hiding something out of place with the character-Seal was more lucky than clever. I got it, because the weakness is there in this slick performance, you just have to look closely.\n",
      "8   Sep 29, 2017   Tom Cruise once again refuses to act his age, this time prancing merrily into some extreme mayhem and a cadre of mostly notorious, '80s-era newsmakers.\n",

      "10   Sep 29, 2017   It's a grand performance of toothy grins, aw-shucks charm and pure movie star magnetism. Barry's so much fun to watch you keep forgetting he's one of the bad guys.\n",

      "14   Sep 29, 2017   There's an aspirational pleasure in seeing Cruise, now in his mid-50s, jump through these hoops. He knows we prefer him when he shades his easy charm with self-doubt, and Barry has a pleasingly sweaty desperation. But not enough ...\n",
      "15   Sep 29, 2017   The story at times feels too wild, too crazy to be true, but that's what makes it worth telling. \"American Made\" is a real whopper.\n",
      "16   Sep 29, 2017   There's an energy to the flight sequences that I haven't seen since Cruise was screaming about 'the need for speed' more than two decades ago. And there's a jittery, almost cocaine-addled pace to the story.\n",
      "17   Sep 29, 2017   A cocaine-fueled romp that plays like a lightweight blend of Goodfellas and Argo, it's entertaining stuff - as long as you don't expect it to stick to the facts.\n",
      "18   Sep 29, 2017   Stylish, politically savvy, exceptionally well-constructed.\n",
      "19   Sep 29, 2017   It's less the ribald ripped-from-the-headlines commentary it aspires to be than a cynically breezy take on an ugly, unduly buried chapter of American history.\n",

      "1   Sep 29, 2017   American Assassin is a decently made tour of Europe, utilising easy target villains to maximise cheering from audiences willing to accept diplomacy down the barrel of a gun... as long as the gun is held by a nominally handsome American man.\n",
      "2   Sep 29, 2017   American Made feels way too sprightly, too jokey, for a movie about a guy who -- despite his rationalizations -- was a well-paid drug mule.\n",
      "3   Sep 29, 2017   If American Made were limited to what Seal knew personally, some of the dangling threads in Gary Spinelli's script could be written off. As it is, they hint at stories we'd like to know better\n",
      "4   Sep 28, 2017   The point here is not to depict Reagan-era corruption or cartel ruthlessness. The point is a wild ride akin to [the real-life] Barry's own - you may as well enjoy it.\n",
      "5   Sep 28, 2017   American Made delivers so much as rambunctious entertainment that it's easy to miss the film's withering assessment of American foreign policy during the Reagan years.\n",
      "6   Sep 28, 2017   Doug Liman knows something very important about Tom Cruise: the actor is never more interesting than when he's desperate and unlikeable.\n",
      "7   Sep 28, 2017   Still bizarrely boyish, Tom Cruise, 55, hits a recent career high in Doug Liman's American Made.\n",

      "11   Sep 28, 2017   The film may be fact-based but that doesn't stop it from feeling generic, like you've seen it all before. The big difference is that Cruise is spreading his starshine over this one and that (still) counts for something.\n",
      "12   Sep 28, 2017   Cruise doesn't seem fully suited to the role of lovable reprobate, but he knows how to capture an adrenaline rush and his charisma is, as ever, undimmed.\n",
      "13   Sep 28, 2017   It's everything you could want from a flashy true-crime biopic skewering the hypocrisy and malice of the Reagan Administration's covert war in Central and South America.\n",

      "17   Aug 23, 2017   Hard to classify and as unpredictable as its protagonist, this comedic drama is part political satire, part absurdist crime caper, part conspiracy thriller.\n",
      "18   Aug 23, 2017   Cruise is on top form in a based-on-fact thriller that overcomes its familiar trappings with audacious details and flat-out pacing.\n",
      "19   Aug 23, 2017   Cruise is as compelling as ever with charm to spare, and this is a ceaselessly entertaining, sometimes tense romp. Although it doesn't dig much below the surface.\n",
      "0   Aug 22, 2017   It's refreshing to see Tom Cruise return to a more character driven piece, playing Barry Seal in Doug Liman's unashamedly entertaining drama American Made.\n",
      "1   Aug 22, 2017   An engrossing true-crime tale spirited in its energy and potent in its execution.\n",
      "2   Aug 22, 2017   A forgettable flight of fantasy.\n",
      "3   Aug 22, 2017   Pictures about the underside of the American Dream are as old as Citizen Kane (actually, older). Still, there's no harm in Liman throwing one more hubristic tale into the pile; certainly not when it's this fun and frantic, shot with grimy vigour.\n",
      "4   Aug 17, 2017   Superb storytelling, tense action, wonderful use of music, a lively sense of fun and Tom Cruise at his very best in a tale that is - well - extraordinary. In short, it's great entertainment.\n",
      "5   Aug 17, 2017   The draw, however, remains Cruise, figuratively walking out on a wing; whether multiplexers rejoin him there will be seen, but after endless formula runouts, it's encouraging to see him being properly exercised again.\n",
      "6   Aug 17, 2017   Kudos are due to Liman and Spinelli... for honing the script into a reasonably manageable two-hour romp around the Byzantine conspiracy-caper seen through the eyes of Seal.\n",
      "7   Aug 17, 2017   A sweat-slicked, exhausting but glibly entertaining escapade on its own terms, \"American Made\" is more interesting as a showcase for the dateless elasticity of Cruise's star power.\n",
      "8   Aug 17, 2017   The problem is that Cruise, even when trying to cut loose, is always so tightly controlled that we never truly feel the reptilian survivalism of Barry Seal.\n",
      "9   Aug 17, 2017   The film's loose period vibe proves diverting and mostly engaging, as well as driving its sunny-hued visual style.\n",
      "10   Aug 17, 2017   ...a propulsively entertaining ride through the underbelly of America...\n"
